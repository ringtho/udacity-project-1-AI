4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: resnet and alexnet
All the three models had the same percentages of "Not a dog correct", "Dogs correct" and "Breeds correct". The "match labels" was the only aspect of difference among the three architectures as vgg had 50% as it could not identify the object coffee mug. alexnet and resnet both had 75% for matching labels. Therefore resnet and alexnet are inseparable from my uploaded image classification.
